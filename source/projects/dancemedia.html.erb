      Dance is all about movement, curve or sharp, fast or slow rhythms,
      repetition, choreographies... We wanted some elegance and simplicity for
      the website, and because dance is about body and the essenciality of its
      movement, the colors are just white, black and the orange of the brand.
      Orange appeared like the body in movement, that, as the fire, leaves its
      light trail on the space. The website is full of geometric forms and
      curves that stablish this connection with movement and freedom..

        The palette is made up of patterns, dark greys and whites. These
        patterns work well as a background with the dark grey or white version
        of the logo, or as the interior colour of the small ampersand when the
        logo appears on white surfaces.

      Dancemedia needed a typeface that was fresh, a bit elegant and with good
      redability for big titles and body text. Helvetica us a universal stylish
      typography that allows a lot of options for bif titles and small text.

          Content layouts were used to incorporate all the different elements
          and features we wanted on the homepage. These content blocks allowed
          us to identify what content was important to users on each page. This
          is what the layouts above looked like without images added.
