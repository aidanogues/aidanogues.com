      Gallery shop & Artists Recruitment
    </h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      The Gallery is Camaloon’s online shop, curated by myself, where thousands
      of designs by cutting edge designers can be found and used by customers to
      personalise a wide range of products. The project began with the wide
      selection of top-rated illustrators and elaborating a business plan,
      working with templates and vectors to transform select designs into
      products, etc. Webpages were built to showcase the works, initially
      ordered by product category and theme, although users can additionally
      search for artists by name.

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Atelier Content Library</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      The Atelier is Camaloon's customising platform where users create their
      own products with their chosen designs. Not everybody has design tools at
      their disposal and/or knowledge to create complex designs, so my aim was
      to provide users with a wide selection of icons, clipart files and
      templates to make their designing process faster and more enjoyable with
      high visual value. For ease of use, the Atelier Content Library has been
      ordered by use cases (weddings, parties, work theme, restaurants, etc.)
      and also by theme (ribbons, frames, animals, tattoos, emojis, etc.). The
      Library can be used as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      1/ Select Use Case.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      2/ Select Favorite Template.

      alt="camaloon-atelier"
    />
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      3/ Once the selected template has been dragged and dropped on a product,
      the colour of any of the elements can be edited as well as their size
      and/or position.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      4/ There is also a wide selection of fonts and font colours to choose
      from.
