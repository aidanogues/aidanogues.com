    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      Childline India is a Line Call service that helps indian children that are
      in situations of abuse or violence to get support. It is present in the
      whole country and 24 hours a day. Children are able to call any time and
      volunteers go directly to the point of conflict. They also collaborate hand
      to hand with other national services to organize events or bigger campaigns
      for this cause. My aim was to highlight the donation path, to make the
      foundation grow in resources to help children in need. Essential information
      has been organized and more attractive content related with the campaigns
      has been added to engage with users.

      Overview and main problems
    </h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      This is the original website of Childline. It has evident problems
      organizing the information properly, and the hierarchies are messy and
      really confusing. The main income generated by the user donations needed to
      be more evident and appealing to the user.

      User research & User insights
    </h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      Two segments of user has been researched in this flow. On one side, the
      potential donors or the skeptics, the ones that are sensitive to human and
      social rights but don't trust in NGOs because they think they are not
      transparent with money. They usually trust in small projects and with
      something in return, like crowdfunding model. On the other hand, the usual
      donors or the motivated, users that are used to donate and they usually
      collaborate with well known platforms.<br />
      After the research, the main goals of the site were:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-32">
      <li>Transparency</li>
      <li>Crowdfunding flow</li>
      <li>Engaging content</li>
      <li>To show process and results</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      These are some of the answers of the surveys I did to current donors and
      skeptic or potential donors.

      With all the answers gathered, I started organizing them by topics, pain
      points and recurrent answers

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Mind map</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      The mind map is useful to organize the different ideas by finding the root
      of the problem or the statement.

    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">

      research:

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Empathy map</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      I focused in the potential donor user persona to develop an empathy map. By
      thinking as my user I could see his main pain points and empathize with his
      needs and expectations.

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">User Journey</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      The user journey allows to imagine a happy path of the analized user, how he
      reaches the product, what does he thinks while surfing the website, how are
      they needs accomplished and how is his mood in the whole process.

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Wireframes</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      These are the first mid-wireframes I made to understand the donation process
      of the user, going through a reward and having the chance to donate also the
      reward.

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Moodboards</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      The essential keywords of this project are transparency, engaging experience
      and kids. My research in the touch and feel of the new website drove me to
      bright and flat colors to represent a closer approach to the children cause,
      big kids photos and powerful typography in a dark grey to be bold in the
      message to spread. I also found layout structures that were suitable for me,
      like colored cards or progress bars.

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Colors</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      The palette is composed by 5 main bright and vibrant colors, that remind me
      of an indian textile, joyful and playful. The color is also present in
      bitonal photographies of children, mixed with a navy blue. The palette
      completes with a dark and a light grey and the white color that gives more
      power to the whole palette.

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Photography</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      The approach to the whole website was to be transparent but bold. The
      content of the projects has been also built around these two concepts.
      Photography bounce between no-filtered colors, to show the real experience
      of projects, and duotonal colors, a more aspirational approach to the
      concept of joy in childhood.

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Typography</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      Brandon Grotesque is used mainly in high case as the display typography. Its
      attitude combined with its humanistic approach makes it perfect for strong
      messages in an NGO platform. For the reading texts, Open Sans is a clear,
      modern and clean typography that allows to read long texts.

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Mobile UI Design</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      Based on our target user, I wanted to keep the site simple, clear and
      transparent. I started with a mobile-first version were projects and
      donations with rewards are highlighted.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Payment flow</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      Payment flow is a key flow in the website. Users choose a project to donate
      and receive a reward and then they can see how the NGO distribute the money.
      The transparency is visualy shown as user can see that part of the donation
      allows to pay salaries or office expenses, to keep the NGO structure alive.
      Also users can decide to keep their reward or increase the children help not
      taking it

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Interactions</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      Interactions are important to focus the attention of the user in some
      important parts of the flow. I have highlighted the project goals and the
      progress bars of the campaigns with animations.
