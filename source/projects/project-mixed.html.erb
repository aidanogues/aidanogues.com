      Mixed Republic is a platform dedicated to supporting and amplifying the
      world of handmade printing, both raising awareness online and offering

      We were seeking to identify an aesthetic approach that evoked the classic
      handmade printing process. I took repetitive images such as a stamped
      border, the CMYK color mode and bold, easy-to-print typography.

    <h3 class="text-center font-bold mb-8 text-3xl">Colours</h3>
    <p class="text-center text-2xl mx-auto text-gray-800 mb-8">
      I chose white and black combined with pixelated photographs â€“ an element
      that is commonly used in silkscreen printing. To be able to print a photo
      using this popular handmade printing technique, you have to convert the
      image to CMYK dots, resulting in an illusion of a picture that uses the
      entire colour spectrum. This CMYK pixelated background has become the most
      recognisable element of the Mixed Republic brand.

      The pixelated version would be used universally - except when a given
      format would not allow it. In such cases, it would be necessary to use the
      positive or negative version of the black and white logo.

      Raleway is a great font for its boldness and cleanness in particular its
      Light version, which is both clear and readable.
