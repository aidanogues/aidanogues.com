            <h3>Moodboard</h3>
            <h4>We were seeking to identify an aesthetic approach that evoked the classic handmade printing process.
            I took repetitive images such as a stamped border, the CMYK color mode and bold, easy-to-print
            typography.</h4>

            <h3>Colours</h3>
            <h4>I chose white and black combined with pixelated photographs â€“ an element that is commonly used
            in silkscreen printing. To be able to print a photo using this popular handmade printing technique,
            you have to convert the image to CMYK dots, resulting in an illusion of a picture that uses the entire
            colour spectrum. This CMYK pixelated background has become the most recognisable element of the
            Mixed Republic brand.</h4>

            <h3>Logo marks</h3>
            <h4>The pixelated version would be used universally - except when a given format would not allow it.
            In such cases, it would be necessary to use the positive or negative version of the black and white
            logo.</h4>

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <h4>Raleway is a great font for its boldness and cleanness in particular its Light version,
            which is both clear and readable.</h4>
